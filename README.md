#Binary Search Algorithm in Java
This Java project implements the Binary Search algorithm, a fundamental searching algorithm used on sorted arrays.

Overview
Binary Search is a highly efficient searching algorithm that operates on sorted arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the interval becomes empty.

Implementation
The BinarySearch class contains a static method binarySearch that performs an iterative binary search on a sorted integer array.


public class BinarySearch {
    static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        // Implementation details...
    }

    // Example usage in the main method...
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage...
    }
}
How to Use
To use the binary search algorithm:

Input Array: Define a sorted integer array in the main method.
Set Target: Specify the target element you want to find within the array.
Method Call: Call the binarySearch method, passing the array and target element as arguments.
Output: The method will return the index of the target element if found, or -1 if not present.
Example

int[] arr = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
int target = 10;
int result = BinarySearch.binarySearch(arr, target);
if (result == -1)
    System.out.println("Element not present");
else
    System.out.println("Element found at index " + result);
This will output:


Element found at index 3
